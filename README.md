# Software-GR25003-AS25040-Schoudertest-LUMC
This software has been developed to measure co-contraction indices (CCI's) of the anterior deltoid (AD) and posterior deltoid (PD) using surface EMG (sEMG) data during isometric contractions in forward flexion (FF) and backward flexion (BF) with varying exeterd torque (ET) and angles of abduction (AOA). This software has specifically been developed to measure co-contraction in Obstetric Brachial Plexus Injury (OBPI) patients. 

This GitHub builds upon existing software: 
_van der Hart, S., Pelk, C., Swanenberg, B., & Vlug, S. (2025). Developing a real-time sEMG-biofeedback
prototype to stimulate co-contraction of the shoulder adductors during abductor contraction in subacromial pain
syndrome rehabilitation. TU Delft / LUMC._

**The Features that were built upon**
- General User Interface to select specific contraction indices
- Acquisition and processing of multi-channel sEMG data via NI-DAQ hardware
- Data storage in JSON files

**Self Developed Features**
- Real-time validation of sEMG signals
- Acquisition and processing of torque data
- Live feedback of ET measurements
- Shape-based CCI calculations 

**Instructions**
1. Run the _validation.py_ to validate the acquired sEMG signals
2. Aqcuire sEMG and ET data during isometric contractions by running _100% MVT.py_
3. Run the _30% MVT.py_ file to provide real-time ET feedback, store sEMG data and simultaneously calculate CCI's with the function from _CCI.py_
4. Calculate the CCI's of 100% MVT ET measurements afterwards by running _CCI 100% MVT.py_
5. Store data in a structured way by running _Data Storage.py_
